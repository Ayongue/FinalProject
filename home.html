        <p id="q"> 
            Delta Sigma Phi has a strong partnership with the American Red Cross, actively supporting its mission through a variety of charitable efforts. One of the primary ways the fraternity contributes is by hosting blood drives on campus, encouraging students and community members to donate blood and make a difference in the lives of those in need. In addition to these blood drives, Delta Sigma Phi raises funds through philanthropy events, donating a portion of the money earned to the American Red Cross to further its life-saving programs and services. This collaboration not only provides crucial support to the organization but also strengthens the fraternity’s commitment to serving others and making a positive impact in the community.

        <p id="q">Delta Sigma Phi actively supports the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) through various philanthropy events and initiatives. As a chapter, we raise funds during these events, with a portion of the proceeds being donated directly to the ASPCA to support their mission of preventing animal cruelty and providing essential care to animals in need. Additionally, we work to raise awareness about the organization's work by advertising and promoting the ASPCA through social media, flyers, and word-of-mouth, encouraging others to get involved. This partnership allows us to contribute meaningfully to the well-being of animals, while also fostering a sense of community and compassion within our fraternity.
